An iOS app for SUSTech CS303 Artificial Intelligence using ModelArts to identify leaves.

Thanks to 曹畅 for providing ModelArts support, 舒天野 for providing leaf datasets, and 姚斯聪 for providing the name "Leafferentiate".

The identified picture and predicted result will be displayed on the app's home view

  - Confidence: possibility of the leaf name matching the picture in percentage

## April 2020 Update

My interviewer asked about the difference between Leaferentiate and major plant identification apps out there in the market. My answer wasn't quite satisfying, but I actually thought about this when I was deciding what features to implement on this app. Despite possibly more fancy UI/UX, faster query time, bigger dataset, and better accuracy, a nice feature that I gave up was plant description in the result. This requires pre-attached descriptive text to plant names or real-time web searching.

Current apps in App Store even provide corresponding Classical Chinese poetry entries for the plant as well as scenery recommendation based on user's current location. More ambitious apps would try to equip themselves with social functionalities and create communities for their users where they can post their thoughts and chat with friends.
